                "In order to build a hardware spiking neural network (SNN) using the spatiotemporal learning rule (STLR), there have been some constraints when it comes to the input signal patterns. In previous studies, the synchronous digital pulse signals were used. In addition, an evaluation method using the output patterns based on a multistage template matching on a 2-D Hamming distane map was proposed."

                "In this study, as a step towards achieving a STLR SNN, pulse width modulated (PWM) binary signals are introduced. The method multistage template matching is also employed to find good learning parameter sets for the PWM spatiotemporal inputs."
